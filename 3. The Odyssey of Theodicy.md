# The Odyssey of Theodicy

There is so much wrong with the American religious right that I can no longer submit myself to being labelled anything remotely associated to what they would label themselves.

My theodicious issues aren't exactly the same as what they would be for most people, i.e. the Problem of Evil, since I had dealt with that adequately as a Calvinist. But I think it has to do with the fact that so many are led astray. If Jesus came to purify the people of God, to weed out the corruption of the Pharisees, how could it be that the Christian chirch of 2,000 years later were a billion times more corrupt than the Pharisees? It's not quite the Holocaust, and it's not quite the Reprobation problem, though it's similar. Basically, it's the parable of the wheat and the tares, except there isn't any wheat in the tare field.

Consider the issue of slavery. There are many in the south who believe that according to god's word, slavery is not only permitted, but actually a good thing. Of course, we know this to be untrue, but it's through picking and choosing and elevating some verses over others (e.g. "In Christ there is neither slave nor free" to which most evangelicals completely ignore "male nor female")

Corruption in the House of God should not exist. For the Glory of his name he would never allow it.

As former pastor Mike Aus described it in an interview on _Up With Chris Hayes_, if church life functioned all that well, we'd see a much higher quality of life among the needy in particular religious areas. But we don't. This is one of the things that bothers me about the most recent election cycle, with the GOP and others saying that it's the responsibility of the church and not the government to provide charity. You can't manage your government on the assumption or contingency that Christians are going to behave in a Christian manner. Because chances are, they won't. Divorce rates and abortion rates are both higher among Christians than unbelievers.

#Dystheism vs Theodicy
The problem of evil
“Why does God allow bad things to happen?”

There are two categories that are really pivotal in my thoughts and opinions on theism. These are “theodicy” and “dystheism”. The definitions of these terms are very similar, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there were people out there who use them interchangeably. But I think the terms are distinct in their level of precision. 

Theodicy is “the problem of evil.” So this would be something that theologians have been discussing for years. The typical answer from an average pastor might be that evil is a result of the Fall of Man, when a literal Adam followed a literal Eve in a literal garden eating a literal fruit, that at that point sin entered their lives and was passed down through the generations like an infection. Some charismatic books say that the fact that God “allows” evil is that he’s given mankind “dominion” over the Earth and it’s our job to stand up and conquer it.

“Why does God cause bad things to happen?”

Dystheism, on the other hand, is the idea that God is not merely passive or apathetic, but actively, intentionally, bad. Old dualistic religions have a good god and a bad god, and they imply that both gods are legitimate, whereas in Christianity, the devil is considered to be a created being with limited power.

The way we can have a conversation about dystheism is by considering “what is good?” and sitting in judgment over God to see whether he measures up.

God in the Dock.

“God is good...”? There is a saying:  “It’s not that God is good because he does good things; but goodness is good because it’s what God does.” But maybe there is a universal goodness that could ...

How about the Golden Rule?  Turns out it occurs in writings older than the Bible. So you don’t need the Bible to know you should treat others how you’d like to be treated.

There is right, and there is wrong. From our perspective, probably rightness entails preservation of ourselves and our homes. Murder and theft is injustice. If you wouldn’t know it’s wrong to murder and steal unless you read about it in the 10 commandments, then you’re not fit for civil society anyway.
