# INTRODUCTION

## Reverse Apologist

So I've entered a new phase in my life. I've lost my religion. Not that I am "lost" in the religious sense—though you may disagree with me—I know exactly where I am. I am not backslidden, as that implies not unbelief as much as rebellion and immorality. No, this is something else entirely, and it's fully moral.

## Good transcends gods

Someone said: "Morality is doing what's right, no matter what you're told. Religion is doing what you're told, regardless of what's right." So many have defended religion as the basis for morality, and too many humanists have allowed them to. But over and over again, religion proves to be the justification for all kinds of evils.

* The oppression of women
* Slavery
* Endless wars
* Genocide
* Zionism

The only way to end these abuses is to convince those who perpetuate them of a higher ethic that does not rely on their religion. We need to convince people to behave with empathy toward one another and to obey the Golden Rule instead of blindly following the dictates of their religious leaders or documents.

My brand of irreligion is not a passive unbelief; it's a _deliberate_ agnosticism. With the political climate clearly emphasizing the fact that Bible-believers have nothing in common with the actual teachings of Jesus, even though we're already on this side of the Reformation. It's not like we can have another Reformation to fix it. Fully 100.0% of the Christian church in America is made up of hypocrites. Scripture says that God will always have a remnant, but there is none. Ether God is wrong or religion is wrong.

(This might not be publishable.)
 
But I have tons of theological background. I have read the Bible cover to cover many times since I acquired the skill of reading, in my youth reading the whole thing annually even. I've done a lot of theological research every time I've had to struggle with a change of viewpoint, e.g. adopting Calvinism, becoming a social/political liberal, etc. As such, the kind of agnostic I will be is a different kind than most you have known.

A sort of reverse apologist. I'll probably quote scripture more than anyone who opposes me, and I guarantee I know it better than you. You haven't encountered anyone like me before. Like the Tories and suffragettes who took the name given to them, I will wear the name of apostate with pride, honor, and dignity, and warmly welcome others coming out of similar disillusionment. 

Mike Aus points out that we are tribal creatures, looking for fellowship. If fellowship is all we need, then we don't need it to be based on myth.
