My dad is a worship leader. He proposed to my mom with the "God told me you're supposed to be my wife" pitch. He gave me names from the bible—"Aaron" and "Jacob"—and he said God showed him some bible verses that applied to me prophetically, meaning that I as his son would have a greater impact in the world. (No pressure, right?) I was raised in one of those churches that claims to be non-denominational but proved it was simply a new denomination with different labels. I played violin and mandolin in a couple Christian rock bands. I ended up a worship leader in my own right and even secretary of the board at a church plant. Through a series of church splits and excommunications and illnesses it's been almost a decade since I've been involved in any church, and I think that has allowed me time to think and to read.

I think I first noticed something was wrong when I saw an episode of 60 Minutes about the remnants of the Branch Davidians in Waco. Yes, they're still there. In the video, the new leader's daughter was playing a Taylor and singing a Tim Hughes song. After that I could never sing that song again.

The last church I had a leadership role in, I noticed some things were a bit off about their statement of faith. I did a ton of research and prepared a 12-page document explaining my position. But then I realized there was no way these home-schooling fundies would keep me around if I told then I accepted the scientific validity of evolution and the Big Bang.

Then people who went to a church I had helped plant (but then left) killed one of their kids by beating them to death with a plumbing supply line. They read a book about how to raise kids god's way and a huge portion of it was about beating them. Thankfully, they are now in prison, and the rest of their kids are now being raised by healthy parents, going to real schools, prom, etc.

This event had a huge impact on me. It was the first time I saw people close to me use scripture as a justification for evil. It made it clear to me that there were probably more Christian terrorists than there were Muslim. All those us-versus-them arguments about whose religion was the more violent went out the window. But the reaction of most of my Christian "friends" on the various social networks was "oh great, now they're going to paint all us Christians who spank our kids as crazy people." My reaction was "people, it's not about you!" People's reactions to our calls for gun control after the recent shootings are exactly the same.

Chris Hitchens points out that the Christian religion attracted the uneducated, and recent studies have shown that conservatism attracts people with a certain brain structure that makes thm selfish individualists, while liberalism attracts people with another structure that make them altruistic. Ironically altruism is the thing which Jesus of Nazareth preached in the Sermon on the Mount, but these days Christians are all about signing up for their "get out of hell free card" instead of actually becoming the kind of loving people Jesus told them to be. The worst thing about Christians is when they emphasize "gospel" over "law" but live like devils, or forget their neighbors and oppress the poor, thinking that at least they "believe" the right things so nothing else matters. James said faith without good works is dead.

So I thought I'd try to be a liberal Christian instead of a conservative one. But eventually I realized in order to be a liberal you still have to pick and choose which scriptures you accept. For example, the Bible condones slavery, the ownership of women as property, and the execution of rebellious teenagers. The story of the Exodus, in which God performed his own "slaughter of the innocents" in the final plague, became particularly problematic. I eventually realized I had to either become a Marcionite heretic or drop the whole thing.

I still have this misguided illusion that I could accept Jesus' teachings and throw everything else out. I had a little bit of trouble with C.S. Lewis' "liar, lunatic, or lord" reasoning. I didn't want to throw out the baby with the bath water, but ultimately, I knew the church as we know it is not his body. Christopher Hitchens and New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman helped me through all this, as well as Dan Dennett, who is my atheist Santa Claus hero.

So now I'm going to pull a Thomas Jefferson and do some picking and choosing of what we can keep from the Bible and what's out.

The first half of Genesis is out. Yahweh's genocidal ways are out. So basically half the Bible is out. The apocalypse is out.

Oh, and hell is out, too.

Jesus moral teachings are still incredibly relevant. At least I think so. Of course, then you have critics pointing out that "He who is without sin cast the first stone" wasn't in the oldest manuscripts. That sucks, because it seems right on.

The Psalms are beautiful. Skip the imprecatory Psalms, though.

James on the evils of the rich. Dude is awesome.

Saul of Tarsus: "In Christ, there is no Jew, nor Greek, male nor female, slave nor free."

Southern fundamentalists rejected this outright because they wanted to keep their slaves. Modern fundamentalists reject it because they don't want to give women equal status. Modern eschatological wackos reject it because they still think Jews get a free pass and therefore side with Israel at all costs against the Arab Muslims and Christians whom they kill and opress on a daily basis.

The verse above is obviously morally right. You don't have to balance it out with those verses that say women shouldn't teach because it's obvious which verse is moral and which one is religious. Besides, according to Ehrman, those sections were pseudepigraphal.

Where do I go from here?

I hope to be a more moral and gracious and kinder person as an atheist than I ever was as a believer. I think I just need to be a good husband and a good and loving father, and let morality guide me instead of the oppressive mysogyny of Christianity.
