# A chronology of conversion

Things started getting bad when the church splits happened. Churches split because they thought the parent church was failing to live up to true Christianity. In leaving people lost their community. If they found another they would either have to start from scratch like kids moving to a new school, or if they were in the company of others who left then they'd have the shared memories of the old community and start thinking of half of their friends as being on the wrong side of the schism. Or they might not have found anything at all and they'd just be alone.

Then the new place would have a schism of their own. And on and on. I've gone through at least four of these. No, five.

Eventually I found myself at a Presbyterian church. Not the denomination that split from the other, but the one that traced itself back to Philadelphia in the 1700s. The only reason this church was not part of the Church of Scotland was that it wasn't in Scotland. But that was okay because it had a Presbyterian (Greek presbyteros: elder) polity (church politics) and not Episcopal (Greek episkopos: bishop/overseer) that would require a centralized leadership. It was considered the wrong side of the schism by those who left, of course, those who were conservative and thought the parent church.

It was fun for a while. It was an ancient building (which in the U.S. means over 100 years old) with a high bell tower that you could hear from a mile away. I figured this was as close as you could get to the traditional strain--the one that people split from as opposed the ones that left--except for the Protestant Reformation itself, which seems to be a legitimate split to me. Even as an atheist I still appreciate the Reformation.

But first let's backtrack one or two church hops.
