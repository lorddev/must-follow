When I was very young I started writing a novel. I remember there was a young man and a mirror. It was a through-the-looking-glass story before I had ever read Lewis Carroll. The type of story where everything is reversed. Words are backwards. Southpaws are northpaws. Left-brain people become right-brained; and the heart is on the other side of the chest.

I remember the excitement I had when all the ideas started flowing. I remember showing my notebook to my friends. It had something to do with the kind of person I wanted to be.

I spent my whole life cultivating discipline and righteousness. We called it _integrity_, but that's not really what it was. I rebuked my friends for not getting straight A's, because if you do everything to the glory of God, that means studying and learning as well. I was the boy whose parents opted him out of the sex-ed portion of health class, spending that time in the library instead. I wore Christian T-shirts. As a creationist, I argued with my science teachers and when I answered questions on tests I wrote one answer for what we were taught in class and another answer detailing my biblical opinion.

Jocks used to pick me up and put me in trash cans. I thought of it as persecution, but really, they were committing an act of self-defense against the annoying little self-righteous know-it-all prick who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.
