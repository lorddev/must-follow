# A Chronology of Deconstruction

## Background

I am the son of a worship leader. As early as I can remember, Sundays were long days--arriving first so my dad could set up and do sound check, and leaving last after my dad had packed up. Even as an adult it was that way for me, too. When there were evening services, the afternoon was very short.

I grew up in Calvary Chapel. I was "spiritually" advanced for my age, 5th grade going to the youth group Sunday school, participating in small group discussions and having all the "right" answers. I played the violin and was told I was gifted. I was taught that the gift was given to me by God and was to be used to his glory. I completely internalized that but when someone else would say, "Oh Aaron, that music you just played for the Christmas Eve service sounded so good," I would have a hard time appearing gracious, I'd be all like you should give the glory to God, and if I said anything like that out loud (God I hope I didn't) it would have come off as super arrogant.

I was a super goodie-goodie kid. I wore Christian T-shirts, listened to Christian music. I got beat up by bullies at school, I thought I was being persecuted but maybe people just thought I was annoying.

I lived for summer camp. There was something about the retreat experience, of being away from it all. Every time I went to camp I would recommit myself even though I never actually backslid. It wasn't like I was cussing, listening to secular music, smoking, making out with girls, or even getting bad grades. I actually got baptized twice even though it's supposed to be a one-time deal. I guess I was worried that the first time didn't stick.

## Malibu

When I went to college I went through this process of making my faith my own. As soon as I  got there I learned that the so-called "non-denominational" denomination that ran the university that gave me a music scholarship believed that musical instruments were profane and not worthy of use in a church context. So I was forced to find church off-campus. I went to the Vineyard, which was a step more charismatic than Calvary Chapel, to the consternation of my parents, but I felt like it was safe since the movement grew out of Calvary and we were singing all of their worship songs anyway. I started praying in tongues. And it was my first encounter with people who weren't rapture-crazy. 

Youth ministry with famous band Lifehouse, recorded and practiced 1998-2000. Participated in the young-adults ministry at the same time, was bullied by leaders into choosing the latter exclusively, managed to avoid doing so. We'll go ahead and call it Spiritual Abuse. I played in the grown-up bands, the youth band, and YA band.

Scotland missionary trips in 1999 and 2000, I felt I was "called", like it was my destiny or something. The first year was awesome. I'd play fiddle and people would come out of the woodwork and just start dancing. One old Scottish lady said, "Ye have a celtic spirit about ye."

So we're on this short-term missionary trip to Scotland. The official state Church of Scotland is Presbyterian (Europe doesn't have the same separation of church and state that we do). So it wasn't like we were trying to convert pagans. If you're a missionary you need to witness and if you're going to witness you need a testimony.

Chrissy Stroop wrote in _Empty the Pews_ that it's hard for those who grow up in the church to articulate a testimony.

> A lot of kids raised in sheltered evangelical environments struggle with this, because when your mom or dad led you through the sinner's prayer whe you were a toddler, it can be hard to paint a convincing picture of transformation, of a before and after. Many evangelical kids secretly envy the testimonies of adult converts who can tell stories of drug addiction or sexual promiscuity as parts of their preconversion lives that God gave them the strength to give up.

My testimony had to be based on my experience. I said it was that I could feel the Holy Spirit during worship. Only after deconstruction did I realize that itâ€™s simply music that produces those feelings of transcendence. Even without words or In a church. I should have remembered that from my youth orchestra days. 

It came down to choosing whether to return to Scotland for 2 weeks or to spend those 2 weeks in immersive rehearsal with the band for the first tour. I chose Scotland because I believed it was God's will. I chose wrong. When I got back the producer informed me they had decided to tour as a 4-piece and as the multi-instrumentalist I was considered unnecessary. They said they'd call after the first tour and I could be on the second. They never called. I now accept that it was my fault, and I owe an apology to those toward whom I harbored resentment for so long. If I had made a rational decision based on what I wanted to do career-wise instead of believing the voice of my imaginary friend, things would have gone differently.

Meanwhile at church: the youth pastor turned out to be a pedophile and he had molested an important young future actor who was just in jr. high (he has gone on to make a few blockbusters). So the youth pastor split the country before he could be brought to justice, and the entire youth group was traumatized. I myself felt a little funny looking back on a time he had invited me to get away and spend some time in a fancy hotel with him. The senior pastor's son took over and we all kind of tried to have some large-group therapy on a charter boat to Catalina on Labor Day, with a lot of bonding and probably some self-reflection about sexual harassment.

Early on the church had rented an elementary school lunch room on Sundays and kept all their stuff in storage containers. But suddenly there was a lot of talk about money. The pastor had a Malibu townhouse and an expensive Mercedes SUV. The church bought a building for millions of dollars and customized it with state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems and the pastor got a brand-new convertible. The "give more money" stuff was really hard on me because I was really, really poor, and sometimes unemployed. The pastor's son told me I had to tithe on my unemployment check if I wanted to be in God's "favor". When you only get $270 every other week, $27 is a lot of money.



Things started getting bad when the church splits happened. Churches split because they thought the parent church was failing to live up to true Christianity. In leaving people lost their community. If they found another they would either have to start from scratch like kids moving to a new school, or if they were in the company of others who left then they'd have the shared memories of the old community and start thinking of half of their friends as being on the wrong side of the schism. Or they might not have found anything at all and they'd just be alone.

Then the new place would have a schism of their own. And on and on. I've gone through at least four of these. No, five.


My girlfriend went on a longer trip to Scotland, complete with a visa and everything. While she was there she was talking to Calvinists (duh, Church of Scotland). I got into an argument with her about it (I thought Calvinists were evil) and cussed her out and broke up with her over via an international telephone call.


At one point the Y.A. pastor confronted the senior pastor about some accounting discrepancies. So he got kicked out. And the entire young adults group basically left the church. Eventually everyone else left the church, too. I became convinced that most of the problems with the church had to do with the money-making institution that has a building and a mortgage and staff to pay; take all of this away, but keep the community. Make your pastors get day jobs. They called this the "house church" movement. I think it would have been pretty cool if it had taken off but it's really hard to convince people to do it. At least it was in those days, in L.A.

## Chico

With a gaping hole where "spiritual community" would have gone, and nothing left tying me down in L.A., I moved to a small town in Northern California to be with the fellow former band-mate who had also been left behind by Lifehouse, one of two of the four-piece who had been replaced by ringers. I started becoming involved at his Calvary Chapel as a musician and behind-the-scenes guy. Recorded music with the Y.A. band which included my buddy and his brother-in-laws.

I ended up in the enviable position of "church staff", though not as a benefited employee, but as an over-taxed contractor, working on media, radio and podcasts. So much for the get-a-day-job thing? Ended up engaged to a girl, but that turned out to be a very bad idea, ended up in a situation which I believed disqualified me from ministry, but everyone wanted me to stay. Then I got fired by an elder who was actually quite a bit of an asshole type (a former cop who drove his jeep 5 miles under the speed limit). It turned out they wanted to replace me with my young apprentice who could put in more time for less money. And then they actually expected me to stick around and do things for free even after I was fired! After 5 years I couldn't find another job that would actually pay the bills, so I found a job in Las Vegas and moved there for a year. Then I moved back to Chico when I found work at a company that wasn't hiring a year earlier.

I discovered John Piper. I listened to all of his sermons on my iPod and read all of his books. I became a Calvinists because I thought it made the most sense.


Another church split. I spent a year with my parents in Vegas and by the time I got back to Northern California my favorite associate pastor was ejected and I chose to go with him.


## Church plant

Things had changed at church when I came back to town. My future brother-in-law had been on staff but got fired. (He was probably on his way out anyway since he had also become a Calvinist, which is generally looked down upon at Calvary Chapel.) He had a regular midweek Bible study at his house for many years and I encouraged him to make a church of it--I felt it was the closest thing to this "house church" I was longing for--and we finally planted our church. Though we immediately started renting space in a community center instead of keeping it in a house. I made the website, edited the podcasts, led worship, served as secretary of the board; I was told I could be an elder, "eventually". My wife and I had our first kid.

In addition to being a Calvinist I became an amillennialist (that's someone who basically doesn't believe in any of the end-time bullshit that a lot of evangelical whack-jobs believe in). Realized how badly premillennialism had affected the church and resulted in America's horrendous foreign policy and Christians' disdain for education, the cause of them holding church in theaters and strip malls rather than building stone buildings of the Presbyterian type that last for hundreds of years. This is a little contradictory; on one hand I'm condemning buildings but on the other I'm looking at the lack of buildings as a sign of impermanence.

Politics: 2008 came down to Obama vs. Palin and the Trump supporters. We chose Obama even though up to that point I had always voted pro-life. But that kind of marked a big turning point for me. I couldn't be a single-issue voter anymore.

...

Living in God's Two Kingdoms... We are all secular. Atheists and humanists have taken to using the term because Evangelicals call them that. But Secular means laity. It means what happens outside the church building. Jobs are secular. Farming is secular. Shopping is secular. Music is secular. Marriage is secular.

...

Came time to settle on a statement of faith, and we were leaning towards the 1689 London Baptist Confession which is based on the 1647 Presbyterian Westminster Confession of Faith. But exceptions were going to be made.

I felt it was my duty as a co-planter and board member to study and investigate such issues so that the decisions could be made with integrity.

Should someone be accepted or rejected based on his or her affirmation of Young Earth Creationism, a literal seven days that happened a handful of generations before Abraham? (Against all evidence, they believe the universe is only 6,000 to 10,000 years old.) The LBC says the earth was created "in the space of six days, and all very good"; were we saying "literal" six days, or a literary/poetic work week? Because there were different ways it could be interpreted;

How about someone who works every Sunday (the Christian Sabbath) and therefore can't ever come to church? How could he be a member when he can't actually participate? And what about the Fourth Commandment? ("Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.") How in the hell do Christians get to pick-and-choose from the 10 commandments by committee? What's the point of Republicans putting the 10 commandments on courthouses to provoke the ACLU into suing you if they don't count? And if Christians reject one of the ten commandments why do they still hold to the lesser commandments that say homosexuality and fornication are sins?

A decade ago when John Piper began to accept Presbyterians into membership at his Baptist church, he said: "Beware of making the doors of your church narrower than the gates of the Kingdom." I had the same feeling, that we shouldn't draw lines where they shouldn't be drawn. Telling people they had to hold to 9 and only 9 of 10 commandments seemed a little non-standard.


I was participating in a church planting, which is what we call starting a new church from scratch. Got married and had our first kid. When it came time to define who was and who wasn't allowed to participate in the church, certain things were outlined, and I felt it was my duty as a co-planter and board member to study and investigate such issues so that the decisions could be made with integrity.

Should someone be accepted or rejected based on his or her affirmation of Young Earth Creationism, a literal seven days that happened a handful of generations before Abraham? (Against all evidence, they believe the universe is only 6,000 to 10,000 years old.)


I read an essay by reformed authors explaining why the age of the earth was undeniable and that Genesis was intended as a literary poem rather than a historical account. I read a very convincing book in support of evolution written by a Christian who worked for a scientific think-tank. It was called _Saving Darwin_, but Karl Gibberson, and I recommend it as a good starting point if you're uncomfortable reading books by atheists.



How about someone who works every Sunday (the Christian Sabbath) and therefore can't ever come to church? How could he be a member when he can't actually participate? And what about the Fourth Commandment? ("Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.") Should a church be able to accept or reject which of the ten commandments still counted? What's the point of Republicans putting the 10 commandments on courthouses to provoke the ACLU into suing you if not all 10 of them matter? And if Christians reject one of the ten commandments why do they still hold to the lesser commandments that say homosexuality and fornication are sins?

The vote came down, my wife and I were the only ones to vote no. The whole rest of the fellowship were basically voting that I should be disqualified from the eldership I had been promised, because even though I subscribed to the entire Reformed confession I wouldn't agree with the one exception they made to it.

We were Excommunicated (called it "church discipline")
Shunned by family. Shunned by good friends in the CD section at Best Buy.

Then someone got sentenced to 22 years in prison because they killed their adopted African daughter by spanking her too much. Because the Bible told them to.

## Adrift



Left that church, went to an even more conservative one where people dressed up on Sundays, A man led worship singing while a lady played the piano. I started leading, doing even older hymns but with my awesome acoustic guitar arrangements (I'm good at reading music). That other guy left because he was offended by my piercings and tattoos, so I had to do it every week instead of just sometimes. That church ended up needing to choose a statement of faith as well, but because of my experience I was determined to not let it affect me as much.

Found they had copied their SoF from John MacArthur's church verbatim. Spent some time advising the pastor on reforming it. Came to see that MacArthur was even stricter on creationism and harsher in his condemnation than most.


...

I embraced Francis Collins and Biologos. Read some books. But then I wanted to read more... To really understand the modern discoveries and closing gaps which had previously been wider but science had predicted the existence of these other intermediate forms...

...

But in that process, the research on the age of the earth, I came to accept evolution as a fact. I basically knew from the outset that I was going to be on the outside on this one but thought we could enjoy the community until it came down to it. But then they started meeting in an abandoned funeral parlor and it just got way too depressing.

...




Eventually I found myself at a Presbyterian church. Not the denomination that split from the other, but the one that traced itself back to Philadelphia in the 1700s. The only reason this church was not part of the Church of Scotland was that it wasn't in Scotland. But that was okay because it had a Presbyterian (Greek _presbyteros_: elder) polity (church politics) and not Episcopal (Greek _episkopos_: bishop/overseer) that would require a centralized leadership. It was considered the wrong side of the schism by those who left, of course, those who were conservative and thought the parent church.

It was fun for a while. It was an ancient building (which in the U.S. means over 100 years old) with a high bell tower that you could hear from a mile away. I figured this was as close as you could get to the traditional strain--the one that people split from as opposed the ones that left--except for the Protestant Reformation itself, which seems to be a legitimate split to me. Even as an atheist I still appreciate the Reformation.

"Science and Religion" were not viewed as mutually exclusive. The associate pastor even wrote a book about the matter.

Started going to a liberal Presbyterian church where the assistant pastor quite literally wrote a book about evolution and reconciling God with science. It was sooooo refreshing to be part of a mainline denomination for a little while, getting attached to historical colonial roots. To say our church wasn't formed by a bunch of So-Cal hippies in the 70s, Nor was it formed by the same Second Great Awakening which spawned Mormonism and countless other aberrations. But was actually the very same Reformed church that came from Scotland and England with 400 years of history since the Reformation. If you wanted to get back to old-school without all the newfangled Evangelical crap, but didn't want to go all the way to Catholicism, then Mainline protestant is the way to go.

But we wouldn't end up sticking around since I was on a two-year path to deconstructing altogether at that point.

I wanted to read more... To really understand the modern discoveries and closing gaps which had previously been wider but science had predicted the existence of these other intermediate forms... Read Jerry Coyne (later revealed to be a fascist misogynist). It was clear he was not sympathetic to the cause of compatibilism. I was able to read the book and learn a lot while excusing his opinions but these planted a seed.


I read Jerry Coyne (later revealed to be a fascist misogynist). He was a real atheist; it was clear he was not sympathetic to the cause of compatibilism. I was able to read the book and learn a lot while excusing his opinions but these planted a seed. I began reading Darwin. I read Harris, Hitchens, and Dennet as research and found myself agreeing with them.

I read _Letter to a Christian Nation_ by Sam Harris and felt like he was a kindred spirit. I read _God Is not Great_ by Christopher Hitchens mainly as a sort of "research" to see how atheists think. Halfway through it I had realized I was agnostic. By the time I finished it I was an atheist.

Robert M. Price's books were very helpful because he had gone through similar changes in thinking to me. He began by criticizing what's wrong with Evangelicalism (_Beyond Born Again_, 1995), but did so in a manner that was sympathetic to Christianity in general--later on he rejected faith altogether (and ultimately, even Jesus).


It was 2013. I stopped blogging. Because I wasn't sure how my audience of Facebook friends would take what I had to say. I hadn't come out to anyone but my wife and kids. Even 7 years later. This blog series is 7 years in the making, and I am only coming out now.

Evangelical subculture is still a big part of who I am. I grew up with it. For most of my life I had read the Bible like brushing my teeth, every morning when I woke up and every night before I went to bed. For most of my life I only listened to Christian music. I still listen to Switchfoot. Even though all my instruments burned in the 2018 Camp fire I still play the hymns I orchestrated on my guitar in my head when I lie in bed at night. Iâ€™m still Reformed, in a sense. When I talk about separation of Church and State I quote John Calvin and David Van Drunen. When I talk about origins I reference Meredith Kline. Iâ€™m not afraid of going to hell because if I were to end up there itâ€™s because I was predestined to go thereâ€”to God be the glory. My ideas about social justice are informed by the teachings of Jesus. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the evidence for his ever having existed is not irrefutable after all.


Now I think I suffer from this thing called Religious Trauma Syndrome. I don't think it's in the DSM-5 but it ought to be, right next to PTSD. There was so much psychological manipulation going on around me for my whole life. I had stayed up nights "wrestling" with God, in anxiety over what his will was for me, whether I should do this thing or that, worrying about whether I was "in his favor." Still, when I left it all, I grieved as if I lost a lifelong friend. He was an imaginary friend. But I didn't know that; he was real for me.

You may say, "I know a lot of people who have been through similar experiences with church splits who haven't walked away from their faith." This is true. But I spent a couple years wrestling with all these questions before I became an unbeliever. I will get into the reasons in later posts. But I'll give you a preview:

The problem of "Why does god let bad things happen" has been discussed ad nauseum by philosophers over the ages. But for me, after understanding evolution and eschatology (end-times theory), I looked around and saw how fucked up all the churches were that were prophesying the end of the world or warmongering for Armageddon, it's not just "how can god allow this to happen", but "how does he let this happen in an institution he's supposedly in control of?" Prosperity preachers and Catholic child molesters can be included in this category. He says he will leave the tares in the field until it's time for harvest. But this field is all tares!
