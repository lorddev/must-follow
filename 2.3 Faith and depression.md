The joy of the Lord.

I just did not feel it.

In 2018 our house burned to the ground in the Camp fire. In 2016 my grandma died. The year before that, my other grandma died. I am familiar with grief. When I stopped believing I also experienced a super long and super hard grieving period. But even before these events I had a problem feeling joy.

In the late twenty-aughts I was working at what I considered my best job ever. And I was damn good at it. But I started getting called in to HR for regular meetings about my personality and was put on probation.

My wife has chronic depression. It's been tough to deal with over the past five years. But there's much more to this story.
 
In 2012, when reading a book for partners/spouses of depressives, I started to realize many of the stories actually described me, not her. So basically, up until that point I blamed everything on her, when it turned out I was having the same issues.  
 
My doctor had me take a quiz and diagnosed me with dysthymia. And apparently 1 out of every 20 people is in the same boat. Though not typically as severe as the depression my wife suffers, it is more chronic, and harder to treat. I suffered side effects from the first medication he gave me. The one he replaced it with is doing better, though I have not noticed any happiness from my so-called "happy pills." It seems that every weekend I have some sort of outburst of anger. It's not cool. 

One of the things that makes it really difficult to deal with dysthymia when you're married to a chronic depressive is that it's often difficult to tell when your reactions are due to your own condition, or in reaction to what the other is doing to you. For example, when one's spouse suddenly decides to go off her meds for a month and a half, and that ends up being the worst 6 weeks of your marriage.

I talked to my doctor and was diagnosed with dysthymia. It's a chronic depression (it never goes away) that has ups and downs and a wavelength similar to bipolar, but the peaks aren't manic: they're never above the baseline of "normal." I've been on meds ever since (and if there's a lapse in my refills I start throwing things around the house). When I told HR and supervisors that I was on meds now, and that this was a thing, they didn't take me off probation or make allowances per the Disabilities act. I didn't last much longer there. And I don't think mentioning my "disability" on later job applications helped.

But clearly this was a thing I had my whole life.




I think when I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed happy pills it had a big impact on me. I had been told my whole life that the Bible commanded me to rejoice in the Lord, and that the fact that I was unable to rejoice meant I was being sinful and unholy. You may reply that God won't tempt you with something you're unable to bear and therefore he only tempted me in this way to get me to figure out I needed pills, and now that I know I'm only sinning if I fail to take them. But that's ludicrous. The fact is, my mental state is a product of my physical brain, not of my supposed immaterial soul. For that matter, anything we do is directly caused by our brains (see Sam Harris, _Free Will_) and therefore a judgment of works makes no sense at all.

If I were still a Christian I would be a Calvinist, so I now have to argue the same point in the scenario where our accountability for sins is not dependent upon any notion of free will, but is a judgment deserved on us through the doctrine of original sin, and that if we only receive the gift of salvation, Christ will free us from that curse. But now there are two points I need to make. First, that any moral person knows that a son is not responsible for the sons if his father. And second, that there is no miraculous change to the brain upon conversion. Doctrinally, we might believe that the Holy Spirit miraculously makes our spirit "raised with Christ and seated in the heavenlies", etc.

My brother-in-law claimed I had inherited an asshole nature from my father, and that both of us were on the wide road to hell because of it. Well, it turned out what I needed wasn't repentance, it was a fucking 33¢ pill.



I tweeted in 2011:

> A diagnosis of depression brings a strange feeling when one has been told his whole life that his behavior is sin/the flesh, or the devil.


I was taught at a young age that self-esteem and psychology we're "humanistic," and that humanism was satanic. Like Frank E. Peretti novel conspiracy-level satanic. If I had known I had a problem, treatment wouldn't have been an option. It would have been prayer and fasting and spiritual warfare.

When I say "I was always taught" it might not be my parents or pastors who were to blame. But there was this whole Christian subculture. Radio "ministries", magazines, camps, concerts...

There was an idea that anything "secular" was by definition invalid. Worldly. Humanist. Basically if anybody had any ideas and that person wasn't a Christian or was speaking from a scientific or academic viewpoint, those thoughts and ideas weren't from the Lord and might even be from the devil.

Speaking of spiritual warfare, if we go back even further to my earliest memories... There was a time when there were noises coming from the attic like pebbles being scattered on a tin roof when our roof wasn't tin... Apparently this wasn't caused by pigeons or possums, or even ghosts, but by demons. So someone came over and anointed the house with oil and the problem went away. My parents probably wouldn't even remember this if you asked them. Things that scare the hell out of you when you're a kid tend to stick with you... For many of us gen-X-ers there are lots of stories we can tell about spiritual warfare, and I don't want to digress into that any more. But I bring it up here as an illustration about spiritualizing things that could be clearly rationalized.

It fell like judgment but it was only rain. —Bad Religion


This is actually something humans have been doing for tens of thousands of years. If there's no rain, it's because the gods aren't happy, so do a rain dance; can't get pregnant? Sacrifice to the fertility goddess. Can't find your shoes? The pixies stole them. Hear a bump in the night? It must be the bogeyman. You got cancer? Let's pray for God to heal you. Got depression? It's sinfulness. It means your faith is weak or something.





But no, it's a chemical imbalance in my brain. If you had scanners powerful enough you could actually look at my head and see the problem.


So by the time I was in 6th grade Job had become my favorite book in the Bible...

...

Paul and his thorns...

Jonah and his shady weed in the desert...

I hadn't realized that Jonah was suicidal. I thought he was just disobedient.

David's Psalms of despair, those are the ones that resonate.

But the songs and sermons at church weren't about brokenness. They were about joy.

So I had to pretend. Fake it 'til you make it. But I wasn't good at that. People used to ask my friends if I hated them because I didn't smile, and my friends would say no, that's just Aaron. The excuse was that I was lost in deep thought or something and maybe I was.

Holy laughter was something our church didn't believe in but then I went to another church that did. I never holy laughed. If people were getting slain I'm the spirit at the altar I would be up there with my arms open waiting for it and dude actually had to push me down by my forehead.

So I sucked at faking it.


"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." Ok, that's something that sounds good. At least Jesus was a little more sympathetic toward broken people.





I read C.S. Lewis Surprised by Joy but wasn't surprised. I read Piper's The Legacy of Sovereign Joy. That was probably a life-changing book. But I didn't get any joy out of it. What did help was the idea that it wasn't my fault that I didn't have joy; if I was ever going to get it, it would have to be thrust on me from a higher power.
