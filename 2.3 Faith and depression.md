"The joy of the Lord." I just did not feel it.

In 2016 my grandma died. The year before that, my other grandma died. In 2018 our house burned to the ground in the Camp fire (along with the whole rest of the town). I am well-aquainted with grief. And when I stopped believing I also experienced a super long and hard grieving period. But even before these events I had a problem feeling joy.

I had been told my whole life that the Bible commanded me to rejoice in the Lord, and that the fact that I was unable to rejoice meant I was being sinful and unholy.

But the songs and sermons at church weren't about brokenness. They were about joy. But I didn't feel it, so I had to pretend... Fake it 'til you make it... But I wasn't good at that. People used to ask my friends if I hated them because I didn't smile, and my friends would say no, that's just Aaron. The excuse was that I was lost in deep thought or something and maybe I was.

Holy laughter was something our church didn't believe in but then I went to another church that did. I never holy laughed, though. If people were getting slain in the spirit at the altar I would be up there with my arms open waiting for it and dude actually had to push me down by my forehead.

So I sucked at faking it.

I was taught at a young age that the idea of self-esteem and the entire field of psychology we're "humanistic," and that humanism was satanic. Like Frank E. Peretti novel conspiracy-level satanic. Anything "secular" was by definition invalid. Worldly. Basically if _anybody_ had _any_ ideas about _anything_ and that person wasn't a Christian or was speaking from a scientific or academic viewpoint, those thoughts and ideas weren't from the Lord and might even be from the devil.

Ligonier ministries puts the cart before the horse and says depression is caused by the sin of [hopelessness/unbelief](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/heart-depression/).

> Think about those things that are good, true, and beautiful, and your brain will demonstrate a certain chemical footprint; indulge sinful imaginations and it will have another.

So even if I had known I had a problem, treatment wouldn't have been an option. It would have been prayer and fasting and spiritual warfare.

## An aside

When I was little there was a time when there were noises coming from the attic like pebbles being scattered on a tin roof when our roof wasn't tin... Apparently this wasn't caused by pigeons or possums, or even ghosts, but by demons. So someone came over and anointed the house with oil and the problem went away. My parents probably wouldn't even remember this if you asked them. Things that scare the hell out of you when you're a kid tend to stick with you...

Overspiritualizing things is something humans have been doing for tens of thousands of years. Sounds from your roof? It's demons. No rain at all? It's because the gods aren't happy, so do a rain dance. Can't get pregnant? Sacrifice to the fertility goddess. Can't find your shoes? The pixies stole them. Hear a bump in the night? It must be the bogeyman. You got cancer? Let's pray for God to heal you. Got depression? It's sinfulness. It means your faith is weak or something.

But no, it's a chemical imbalance in my brain. If you had scanners powerful enough you could actually look at my head and see the problem.

## The diagnosis is mine

My brother-in-law claimed I had inherited anger issues from my father, and he said that Dad and I were both on the road to hell because of it. Well, it turned out what I needed wasn't repentance, it was a fucking 33¢ pill.

My wife has chronic depression. It's been tough to deal with over the past five years. When reading a book for partners/spouses of depressives, I started to realize many of the stories actually described me, not her. So basically, up until that point I blamed everything on her, when it turned out I was having the same issues.  

In the late twenty-aughts I was working at what I considered my best job ever. And I was damn good at it. But I started getting called in to HR for regular meetings about my personality and was put on probation.
 
My doctor had me take a quiz and diagnosed me with dysthymia. And apparently 1 out of every 20 people is in the same boat. Though not typically as severe as the depression my wife suffers, it is more chronic—it never goes away—and it's harder to treat. 

Dysthymia has ups and downs with a wavelength similar to bipolar, but the peaks aren't manic: they're never above the baseline of "normal." I've been on meds ever since (if there's a lapse in my refills I start throwing things around the house). When I told HR and my supervisors that I was on meds now, and that my depression was a thing, they didn't take me off probation or make allowances per the Americans with Disabilities act. I didn't last much longer there. And I don't think mentioning my "disability" on later job applications would have helped.

One of the things that makes it really difficult to deal with dysthymia when you're married to someone with chronic depression is that it's often difficult to tell when your reactions are due to your own condition, or in reaction to what the other is doing to you. (If one's spouse suddenly decides to go off her meds for a month and a half, and that ends up being the worst 6 weeks of your marriage, it's hard to tell who's to blame.)

I tweeted in 2011:

> A diagnosis of depression brings a strange feeling when one has been told his whole life that his behavior is sin/the flesh, or the devil.

The fact is, my mental state is a product of my physical brain and its chemistry, not of my supposed immaterial soul. For that matter, anything we do is directly caused by our brains (see Sam Harris, _Free Will_) and maybe therefore a judgment of works makes no sense at all.

I read C.S. Lewis's _Surprised by Joy_ but wasn't surprised. I read Piper's _The Legacy of Sovereign Joy_. That was probably a life-changing book. But I don't think I got any actual "joy" out of it, though I got the sovereignty part. What did help was the idea that it wasn't my fault that I didn't have joy; if I was ever going to get it, it would have to be thrust on me from a higher power.

But if I were still a Christian I would be a Calvinist, so I now have to argue the same point in the scenario where our accountability for sins is not dependent upon any notion of free will, but is a judgment deserved on us through the doctrine of original sin, and that if we only receive the gift of salvation, Christ will free us from that curse. But now there are two points I need to make. First, that any moral person knows that a son is not responsible for the sins of his father (so fuck original sin). And second, that there is no miraculous change to the brain upon conversion. Doctrinally, we might believe that the Holy Spirit miraculously makes our spirit "raised with Christ and seated in the heavenlies", etc. But if you're like me, you sure don't feel like it.

By the time I was in 6th grade Job had become my favorite book in the Bible...

Paul and his thorns...

Jonah and his shady weed in the desert...

(I hadn't realized that Jonah was suicidal. I thought he was just disobedient.)

David's Psalms of despair, those are the ones that resonate.

"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." Ok, that's something that sounds good. At least Jesus was a little more sympathetic toward broken people like me.
