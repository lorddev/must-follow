So what _is_ the chief end of humanity?

## Environmental Stewardship
There are two strains of thought in Christian and Jewish scripture that are juxtaposed to one another. One is the concept of humanity's role as "stewards" of "creation". That is, Adam tending the proverbial Garden of Eden and classifying the animals was a kind of model for us, to continue and serve nature as conservationists. This is what stewardship means—we aren't owners or rulers over nature, but are accountable for how we take care of it.

The other strain is the apocalytic strain. This strain preaches the impending judgment of all the heathen in a catastrophic blaze of fire in which the heavens and earth will be completely remade. In this strain, God hits the giant reset button on the celestial Atari 2600 and the universe is wiped clean. Fundamentalists influenced by Hal Lindsey's _The Late Great Planet Earth_ in the 1970s are of this strain. For them, global warming is not a problem because it's all gonna burn anyway. Peace in the Middle East isn't something to worry about, because the sooner the Battle of Armageddon begins, the sooner their Rapture will come.

There have been apocalyptic cults throughout the centuries. Seventh-Day Adventists expected Jesus to come back 100 years ago. Before the Mormons were expelled from Missouri, the official teaching of the LDS church was that Missouri would be the location of Christ's return. And we all rememember David Koresh and Harold Camping. (And yes, I'm going to put them in the same boat.) So it's not likely that the apocalyptic strain could be wiped out. Though Jesus said he was "coming soon" and it's been 2,000 years, there will always be those who point out that for God, a thousand years is like a day. But if we want to preserve civilization, we _have_ to get people back on board with the stewardship strain.

I believe the stewardship of creation as taught in scripture, is going to be where we find our meaning. As we transcend our animalism and conquer disease and develop computers capable of imitating intelligence, we are approaching the powers of those gods we used to worship, the superheroes who inspire us to be greater.

In order to fulfill this dream, the eschatological culture war must end. Not since the Reformation have we seen such violent religious attitudes among the public. But the longer we go in our current state—where half of the population wants to usher in the battle of Armageddon to help Jesus come back sooner and doesn't give a rip about either preserving the world, educating our children, or expanding the space program the harder the recovery and healing is going to be.

## Generous Humanism
Karen Armstrong says all the major religions have a version of the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do to you.” Another way to put this is: Love your neighbor as yourself. In this electronic age, our neighbor is no longer just the person nextdoor, but includes people on the other side of the world. Basically, anyone about whose situation you cannot claim ignorance. This universal decree cannot be denied, and those of all persuasions must realize the need to extend neighbor status to all those of other persuasions as well. Put an end to war, exploitation, occupation, etc. Love the Cuban communist as you love yourself. Love the Guantanamo prisoner as you love yourself. Love the liberal Protestant black president as you love yourself.
